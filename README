== General Information

Arrow is a web application framework for mod_ruby. It was designed to make
development of web applications under Apache easier and more fun without
sacrificing the power of being able to access the native Apache API.


== Online Docs

We're working on a manual which will provide more comprehensive instructions
and an in-depth tutorial. You can view it at:

  http://deveiate.org/projects/Arrow/manual/

We'd be happy to hear your suggestions, bug reports, or complaints.


== Installation

=== Requirements

* Apache (2.0 or 2.2) - http://httpd.apache.org/
* mod_ruby (>= 1.2.6) - http://modruby.net/

=== (Non-Standard) Ruby Library Dependencies

If you use RubyGems, appropriate versions can be installed using the
'install_dependencies' Rakefile task. Otherwise, you'll need to build and
install these by hand:

ruby-cache-0.3::      http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-cache
formvalidator-0.1.4:: http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/formvalidator
PluginFactory-1.0.3:: http://deveiate.org/projects/PluginFactory


==== Quickstart

Install:

  $ rake install

The install task will check for dependencies, install the libraries, and then offer some
advice about how to configure your server.
