== General Information

Arrow is a web application framework for mod_ruby. It was designed to make
development of web applications under Apache easier and more fun without
sacrificing the power of being able to access the native Apache API.


== Online Docs

We're working on a manual which will provide more comprehensive instructions
and an in-depth tutorial. You can view it at:

  http://www.rubycrafters.com/arrow-manual/

Keeping in mind that it's a work in progress still, we'd be happy to hear your
suggestions or complaints.


== Installation

=== Requirements

* Apache (1.3 or 2.0) - http://httpd.apache.org/
* Apache Request Library (libapreq) - http://httpd.apache.org/apreq/
* mod_ruby (>= 1.2.0) - http://modruby.net/

=== (Non-Standard) Ruby Library Dependencies

Ruby-Cache::    http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-cache
FormValidator:: http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/formvalidator
PluginFactory:: http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/pluginfactory
HashSlice::     http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/hashslice


==== Quickstart

Install:

  $ install.rb

The install script will check for dependencies, install the libraries, and then
offer to install the demo applets that come with the distribution.


== Current Status

This is a beta release. Things will probably break, but the APIs are fairly
fixed and it's feature-complete for the 1.0.0 release. If you do find something
broken, please let us know.

We'd love to hear from you if you try Arrow out. If it isn't your cup of tea,
let us know why. Of course if you love it, we'd like to hear that, too.
