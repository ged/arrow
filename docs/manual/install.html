	  <h1>Arrow: Installation</h1>

	  <p>As with most things, the hardest part of getting Arrow onto your
		machine is the dependencies.  Depending on your operating system, many
		of these will have packages for easier installation.  It's worth
		checking with all of these, but be careful to verify the versions are
		greater than or equal to what we list as required.  Otherwise, we
		provide here links to what we believe to be the most authoritative
		source of each.</p>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a id="apache">Apache</a></h2>

		<p>All development and testing is done using the <a
		href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 1.3.x series</a> webserver on
		Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOS X, though you should be able to run it under
		other platforms and/or Apache 2.0.x. We'd love to hear about you
		experiences under other configurations, and patches for portability are
		of course always welcomed.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a id="libapreq">The Generic Apache Request Library (libapreq)</a></h2>

		<p>Arrow requires the libapreq extensions to mod_ruby, which in turn
		requires that you install the <a
		href="http://httpd.apache.org/apreq/">Generic Apache Request
		Library</a>, or <tt>libapreq</tt>.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a id="ruby">Ruby</a></h2>
		<p>Using <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/en/20020102.html">Ruby
			(1.8.1)</a> is strongly urged, as the majority of our work has been
			done under the <a
			href="http://ruby-lang.org/en/20020106.html">development</a> version
			of ruby.</p>

		<p>Arrow has also been tested and seems to work under the 1.8.0 release,
		  but that version of Ruby has some known bugs which are fixed in later
		  versions, so if you're having trouble, try a more recent Ruby.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a id="mod_ruby">mod_ruby</a></h2>

		<p>The <tt>mod_ruby</tt> Apache module embeds a Ruby interpreter into
		Apache, much like <tt>mod_perl</tt> and <tt>mod_python</tt> do for
		their respective interpreters.</p>
		
		<p>Arrow depends on the libapreq extensions to mod_ruby, support for
		which was added in version 1.2.0. The current version as of this writing
		is <a
		href="http://modruby.net/archive/mod_ruby-1.2.2.tar.gz">mod_ruby-1.2.2</a>. Arrow
		will probably work with earlier 1.2.x releases, too, but please upgrade
		to the most current one before reporting any problems you might
		encounter.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a id="ruby_libs">Ruby Library Dependencies</a></h2>

		<p>These are the various ruby libraries you will need to install in
		  addition to the standard distributed ones. Known good versions of each
		  one are in the distribution in the <tt>redist/</tt> directory, but you
		  may wish to install newer or customized versions.</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=ruby-cache">
			  Ruby-Cache (0.3)</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=formvalidator">
			  FormValidator (0.1.3)</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=hashslice">
			  HashSlice (1.03)</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=pluginfactory">
			  PluginFactory (0.01)</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here also are some standard libraries that are used but may not be
		  included with your ruby distribution (debian, for instance).</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=strscan">strscan
			  (0.6.7)</a></li>
		</ul>

        <p>Optionally, you can include the following libraries (with a word on
        what added functionality they bring in).</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/test-unit-mock">
		  Test-Unit-Mock (0.03)</a> - to run the tests.</li>

		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/diff">
		  Diff (0.4)</a> - used by TestUnitMock.</li>

<!-- 		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/criteria">criteria -->
<!-- 		  (1.1a)</a> - adds in the ability for DataSources to use this -->
<!-- 		  interesting interface to querying (not presently implemented).</li> -->

		  <li><a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/posixlock">posixlock</a>
		  - Required if you wish to use the 'posix' type of session
		  locking.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="arrow_install">Installing the Arrow Libraries</a></h2>

		<p>Now that all of the dependencies are installed (and you have <a
			href="download.html">obtained the Arrow sources</a>), you can
			optionally test Arrow by running the included unit tests (which
			should all pass...):</p>

		<p><tt>$ </tt><kbd>./test.rb</kbd></p>

<pre>
0 patterns given on the command line
Required 11 files.
Loaded suite Arrow Web Application Test Suite
Started
........................................................................
.....................
Finished in 1.167613 seconds.

103 tests, 2276 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre>

		<p>Finally, put the Arrow ruby libraries in place with the provided
		  installer (you may need root privileges to do this):</p>

		<p><tt>$ </tt><kbd>./install.rb</kbd></p>

<pre>
Arrow Installer Revision: 1.2 
Testing for the Ruby-Cache library...found.
Testing for the FormValidator library...found.
Testing for the HashSlice library...found.
Testing for the Strscan library...found.
Installing...done.
</pre>

		<p>This is going to put the Arrow libraries in place, but will not have
		  set up any default applets, templates or configuration files.  These
		  will need to be added as we <a href="config.html">configure</a>
		  things.</p>
