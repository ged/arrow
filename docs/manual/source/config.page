h1. Configuration

h2. Apache

You'll need to add mod_ruby to the configuration file for Apache, typically named
httpd.conf, if you hadn't done so when you installed mod_ruby. For example, assuming your
mod_ruby.so is installed in $WEBROOT/libexec/mod_ruby.so:

<?example { language: apache, caption: Adding mod_ruby to your Apache config. } ?>
  LoadModule ruby_module libexec/mod_ruby.so
  AddModule mod_ruby.c
<?end?>
		
To associate an Arrow instance with a location in your web space:

<?example { language: apache, caption: Tell Arrow to answer a location in your server.} ?>
  RubyAddPath /path/to/your/Arrow/lib
  RubyRequire arrow
  <Location /your/desired/arrow/url>
      SetHandler ruby-object
      RubyHandler "Arrow::Dispatcher.create('/your/arrow.conf')"
  </Location>
<?end?>

This is the Arrow-specific configuration you'll need to put in, but the rest of this config file
will still need to be set up for a working server. For more information on Apache configuration
files, see the Apache documentation, as well as the mod_ruby documentation.

There are a few more things you can do in the Apache config covered in the "advanced configuration":tutorial/advanced-config.html tutorial.


h2. Arrow

Arrow's config file is written in YAML -- here's a minimal config for a single applet just to get you started:

<?example { language: yaml, caption: Minimal Arrow config file.} ?>
--- 
# The application map. Map functionality onto applet classes.
applets: 
  path:
    - "/usr/local/www/applets"
  layout:
    "/": StatusApplet

# Configure the templating system
templates: 
  path:
    - "/usr/local/www/templates"
<?end?>

All items in the configuration are optional; reasonable default values are provided by
@Arrow::Config::DEFAULTS@. The sections you'll likely want to include in your config are the @applets/layout@, @applets/path@, and @templates/path@ variables.


The YAML format is fairly forgiving of some things, but not of inconsistent indentation.
Make sure your indentation is the same for all items in a section (i.e., if one line uses
tabs, then all lines at the same indent should also use tabs, etc.). Failure to do so might
cause Arrow to fail to start up, or certain parts of your config might be silently
ignored.
