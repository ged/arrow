h1. Arrow

Arrow is a web application framework for "mod_ruby":http://www.modruby.net/, a module for "the Apache webserver":http://httpd.apache.org/ that exposes most of the server's module API to Ruby via an embedded interpreter.

It features:

* reloadable applets that can be chained together
* request and response utilities
* object-oriented templating system
* cookie-based sessions
* form-data validation and untainting
* hierarchical configuration and logging classes

For more information about Arrow's history and design, see "Arrow's History and Design":history.html.

h2. Getting Started

Before you can get started, you have to install and configure some stuff. Nothing too tricky.

* There's some "installation instructions":installation.html in case you don't yet have it.
* Next, you'll probably want to "configure the server":config.html.

h2. Tutorial

Once you have things up and running, you can start writing stuff.
