h1. Arrow

Arrow is a web application framework for "mod_ruby":http://www.modruby.net/, a module for "the Apache webserver":http://httpd.apache.org/ that exposes most of the server's module API to Ruby via an embedded interpreter.

It features:

* all the usual web goodies:
** advanced query-argument handling
** cookie manipulation
** URL utilities
** Multipart (upload) form handling
* reloadable modular application code that can be chained together to form larger 
  applications
* object-oriented templating system
* pluggable cookie-based session management
* form-data validation and untainting
* single-file YAML-based configuration for both the appserver and applications
* Hierarchical pluggable logging facilities

For more information about Arrow's history and design, see "Arrow's History and Design Philosophy":history.html.

h2. A Quick Example

Here's the obligatory "Hello World" example:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "A Hello World applet", test: true } ?>
#!/usr/bin/ruby

require 'arrow/applet'

class HelloWorldApplet < Arrow::Applet

	default_action :hello

	def hello_action( txn, *args )
		return %Q{<html><head><title>Hello, World</title></head>} +
		       %Q{<body><h1>Hello, World</h1></body></html>}
	end

end

<?end?>

The output from this will be something like:

<div class="screenshot">
!images/helloworld.png(Gratuitous screenshot)!
</div>


h2. Getting Started

Before you can get started, you have to install and configure some stuff. Nothing too tricky.

* If you don't yet have Arrow installed, there are some "installation instructions":installation.html.
* Next, you'll probably want to "configure the server":config.html.

h2. Tutorial

Once you have things up and running, you can start writing Ruby.

h2. Cookbook

Once the tutorial is a bit more complete, we'll start putting together some recipes for common
tasks. For now, though, we suggest you take a look at the example applets in the @applets/@
directory of the distribution, and their corresponding templates in the @templates/@ directory.
