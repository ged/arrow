h1. Installation

h2. Step One: Install "Apache":http://httpd.apache.org/

All development and testing is done using the Apache 2.2.x series webserver on Linux, FreeBSD, and
MacOS X, though you should be able to run it under earlir versions or other platforms. We'd love to
hear about you experiences under other configurations, and patches for portability are of course
always welcomed.


h2. Step Two: Install "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/

You probably already have Ruby installed, but in case you don't, you'll need the latest version in
the 1.8.x series. We're interested in running it under 1.9.x, but that hasn't been tested at all 
yet.


h2. Step Three: Install "mod_ruby":http://www.modruby.net/

The @mod_ruby@ Apache module embeds a Ruby interpreter into Apache, much like @mod_perl@ and
@mod_python@ do for their respective interpreters.

Arrow is tested with the latest version, which was 1.2.6 when this was written.


h2. Step Four: Install Ruby Library Dependencies

These are the various ruby libraries you will need to install in addition to the standard
distributed ones. If you install Arrow as a gem, these will be installed for you, but you can
install them by hand, too.

* "ruby-cache":http://www.nongnu.org/pupa/ruby-cache.html (>= 0.3.0)
* "formvalidator":http://grub.ath.cx/formvalidator/ (>= 0.1.3)
* "pluginfactory":http://www.deveiate.org/projects/PluginFactory (>= 1.0.2)


h3. Standard Library		

Arrow also uses some standard libraries that are part of the standard library, but which some
package maintainers may elect not to install with the main Ruby interpreter package. If you have
problems, you may wish to ensure that these are installed.

* strscan (0.6.7)


h3. Optional Libraries

Some of the developer tasks in the Rakefile and some plugins for the server require additional
libraries:

h3. Developer Tasks

* "rspec":http://rspec.info/ (>= 1.0.3) — This is required to run the test suite
* "rcov":http://eigenclass.org/hiki/rcov (>= 0.8.1.2.0) — Used to check test coverage

h3. Documentation Tasks

* "RedCloth":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/
* "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/
* "Darkfish RDoc":http://www.deveiate.org/projects/Darkfish-Rdoc — An alternate template for RDoc


h3. Plugin Dependencies

* posixlock (>= 0.0.1) — Required if you wish to use the 'posix' type of session locking.
* activerecord (>= 1.14.0) — Required if you want to use the 'activerecord' session store.

h2. Installing the Arrow Libraries

Again, if you installed via RubyGems, you won't need to do anything else.

If you're installing from source, now that all of the dependencies are installed, just do:

<pre>
  $ <kbd>rake install</kbd>
</pre>

to install the Arrow libraries.

Next, you will want to "configure the webserver":config.html.
