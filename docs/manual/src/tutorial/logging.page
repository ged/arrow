h1. Logging

You can log stuff. Yeah! Kudos!

* Consists of two pieces: loggers and ouputters
** Loggers pass messages up the inheritance hierarchy, looking for outputters
** Outputters are registered with one or more loggers, and have a logging level. If a message at or above its level passes through one of the loggers it is registered with, it packages up the message and outputs it.
