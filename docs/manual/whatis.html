	  <h1>What is Arrow?</h1>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a href="#overview" id="overview">An Overview</a></h2>

		<p>Arrow is a web application framework for mod_ruby. It was designed
		  to make development of web applications under Apache easier and more
		  fun without sacrificing the power of being able to access the native
		  Apache API.</p>

		<h3>Why <em>another</em> web framework?</h3>

		<p>We chose to write this framework despite the existance of several
		  interesting and excellent frameworks already written in Ruby for
		  several reasons:</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><strong>mod_ruby:</strong> No existing frameworks (that we know
			of) run under <tt>mod_ruby</tt>, or at least not with the same kind
			of access as a first-order handler.</li>

		  <li><strong>Apache</strong>: Some current frameworks are very compelling
			but for one thing: they run using their own webserver written in
			Ruby. While this is fine for some lighter applications, our experience
			showed that this strategy does not scale as well as Apache, nor does
			it allow the application developer to leverage all of the other
			functionality already built in to Apache or available as modules.</li>

		  <li><strong>Advanced features:</strong> While there are some current
			frameworks that provide some of the features we desired for
			application development, there were none that supported them
			all.</li>

		  <li><strong>Extensibility/customizability:</strong> Many of the current
			frameworks make it difficult to override or extend their built-in
			features. We wanted something that would allow us to adapt to any
			situation.</li>
		</ul>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a href="#goals" id="goals">Design Goals</a></h2>

		<p>Our primary intent when creating Arrow was to make development of
		  applications under mod_ruby easier without sacrificing power. To that
		  end, we started with four major goals:</p>

		<ol>
		  <li><strong>Apache API:</strong> The developer should still have
			access to most or all of the Apache API, but without being
			required to know or care about most of it if she does not want
			to.</li>

		  <li><strong>Persistant resources:</strong> Applications should be able
			to take advantage of persistant resources like cached database
			handles, connection pools, etc.</li>

		  <li><strong>No fork overhead:</strong> Like with native mod_ruby
			handlers or registry CGIs, the overhead of the fork and compile
			phase should be minimized.</li>

		  <li><strong>Automatic reload:</strong> Maintain the immediacy of CGI
			with auto-reloaded applications, configuration, and templates to
			avoid the server-restart cycle that is required with every change
			in programming with mod_ruby handlers.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>We also wanted to add some features which are useful in most all web
		  application programming:</p>

		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Templating:</strong> To separate presentation HTML from
			application logic, we decided to provide an integrated templating
			system that uses valid XHTML documents (or document fragments) for
			templates. We also realized that there are already many excellent
			templating systems available for Ruby, and so we tried to make it as
			easy as possible to use your own preferred templating library instead
			of ours if you should so choose.</li>

		  <li><strong>Sessions:</strong> Many web application developers
			find it necessary to maintain state between connections in their
			applications, so Arrow includes sessions that are very easy to use,
			but can be configured to use one of a number of different configurable
			strategies on the back end for storage, locking, and key
			generation.</li>

		  <li><strong>Argument validation/untainting:</strong> Web applications
			need to handle input from end users which needs to be untainted and
			validated against a definition of what constitutes legal
			data. Fortunately, Travis Whitton already wrote an excellent Ruby
			data-validation library called <tt>FormValidator</tt>, which is built
			into Arrow.</li>

		  <li><strong>Modular applications:</strong> Very often, web applications
			need to share several subsystems (e.g., authentication/authorization,
			state checkpointing and validation, etc.) which are orthogonal to the
			main application logic but still necessary. Arrow allows some apps to
			act as delegators, providing some functionality for all apps which are
			chained through it.</li>

		  <li><strong>Graceful error-handling:</strong> Sometimes applications
			fall on their face, and there is little more frustrating than having
			to track down an error trace from within the bowels of your app. Arrow
			provides a customizable error-handling mechanism that can be used to
			speed development and act on errors intelligently.</li>

		  <li><strong>Strong introspection:</strong> One of Ruby's strengths is
			its strong introspection features, and we wanted to build on those
			strengths. Arrow has some powerful introspection facilities that let
			the developer examine the state of applications, templates, sessions,
			etc.</li>

		  <li><strong>Data source abstraction layer:</strong> <em>Database
			  connections, SOAP interfaces, testing datasets, etc.</em></li>

		  <li><strong>Syndication:</strong> <em>RSS, Atom, etc.</em></li>
		</ul>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a href="#status" id="status">Current Status</a></h2>

		<p>Arrow is not currently feature complete. As of this writing it's useful
		  for building applications, and the core API is mostly stabilized, but
		  some of the more-advanced features have yet to be completed.</p>
