	  <h1>Arrow: Tutorial: Input Validation</h1>

	  <div class="section">
	    <p>Most web applications process input from forms at some point in their
		  execution.  While under some circumstances it may be okay to accept
		  incoming data as is, the chance of malevolent data, even from trusted
		  networks, as well as the extent to which such data can compromise a
		  system (through the use of escape, shell and other sequences), makes
		  doing so in today's Internet an extremely bad practice.</p>

		<p>A first line of defense taken by Ruby is to flag all incoming data as
		  tainted, and restrict the use of such flagged data in potentially
		  dangerous operations if the <tt>$SAFE</tt> global variable is
		  non-zero. This "safe" level is set to <tt>1</tt> by default in
		  mod_ruby, and it is recommended that it be kept at that setting for
		  Arrow applications as well. In order to use data which comes from
		  outside of the application, then, it is necessary to <em>untaint</em>
		  it, which means to analyze it for acceptability.</p>

		<p>The analysis step is typically implemented in Ruby with a regular
		  expression, which is applied to the input, and the part of the input
		  which matches the expected pattern is retained.</p>

		<p>In addition to untainting, input data must also sometimes be tested
		  against more-stringent validation routines, such as in the case of
		  credit card numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. </p>

		<p>These data-validation tasks are common enough to web application
		  development that Arrow integrates Travis Whitton's excellent
		  FormValidator library, which provides both validation and (optionally)
		  untainting. It has built in support for validating many different
		  kinds of structured data, giving an application plenty of control over
		  what values are acceptable for any given field with a convenient and
		  consistent interface.</p>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a href="#writing" id="writing">Writing a Validation
			Specification</a></h2>

		<p>The documentation for <a href="http://grub.ath.cx/formvalidator/doc">
		  FormValidator</a> gives a thorough coverage of the different options
		  that are available to control how data gets through.  We give here a
		  brief coverage of some of these, with notes on the specifics of how
		  this package is integrated with Arrow and how it can be used by
		  applications you write.</p>

		<p>To begin with, recognize that any action which expects to receive
		  input must declare a specification for it to get through.  Further, a
		  specification must validate every field of the expected input, or
		  individual fields will not be passed in.  To simplify this, you may
		  end up writing a few base validation schemes that then get extended by
		  each of the actions.</p>

		<p>The specifications are kept in the signature of an application,
		  stored as a Hash keyed by action name, with values of that action's
		  specification.  While it is acceptable to include all of your actions'
		  specifications when the signature is first declared, you may find it
		  more readable to include an action's specification immediately before
		  or after the action itself, thus keeping related information
		  together.  (This is equally applicable to templates, config(?) and
		  monitors(?).)</p>
