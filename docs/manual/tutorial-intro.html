		<p>The term <em>application</em>, used in the Arrow documentation,
		refers to a overarching group of functionality like a <acronym
		title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>, an online customer
		service interface, online event-management, or something similar. Arrow
		was created to allow developers to create large generic applications for
		the web which are easily tailored to a specific installation's
		requirements. Each application is assembled out of small, mostly
		orthogonal applets, which can be combined, re-arranged, swapped out, or
		subclassed to provide branding, custom features, or other customization
		with a minimum of time and effort.</p>

		<p>To achieve this componentization, Arrow is made up of four basic
		parts: a Dispatcher, a Broker, one or more Applets, and Transaction
		objects which are wrapped around incoming requests.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div class="section">
		<h2><a href="#classes" id="classes">The Basic Parts</a></h2>

		<p>An Arrow application looks conceptually something like this:</p>

		<div id="structural-overview-diagram"
			 style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
		  <img src="structural-overview.png" height="250" width="653"
		  alt="[Structural Diagram]"></img>
		</div>

		<dl class="linelist">
		  <dt>Dispatcher</dt>
		  <dd>The Dispatcher is the mod_ruby request handler that is invoked by
		  Apache; it loads the configuration (or reloads it if it has changed
		  since the last time it was read), sets up the Broker, creates
		  Transaction objects for each incoming requests, sends the response
		  headers, and renders the resulting output.</dd>

		  <dt>Transaction</dt>
		  <dd>A new Transaction object is created by the Dispatcher for each
		  request, and then passed to the Broker for handling. It encapsulates
		  the incoming <tt>Apache::Request</tt> object, providing easy access to
		  request values, configuration values, session data, and validated
		  query arguments.</dd>

		  <dt>Broker</dt>
		  <dd>The Broker decides how Transaction objects get handled by loading
		  and building a registry of Applet objects. When the transaction calls
		  its <tt>#delegate</tt> method with a Transaction object, it searches
		  its Registry for applets which have been mapped to all or part of the
		  incoming request's URI.</dd>

		  <dt>Applets</dt>
		  <dd>Applets are objects which handle user requests, and define the
		  basic logic of different parts of the application. They can also be
		  combined to run in sequence via delegation (aka chaining).
		  </dd>
		</dl>

		<p>The default classes provide enough functionality to create a fairly
		large number of different kinds of application, but they are all
		designed with subclassing in mind, so if you don't like the way
		something behaves, it should be fairly easy to customize.</p>
