            /trunk/project.yml (and 3 other/s)

    * Updated build system; added dev dependencies. Thanks to Mahlon for the heads-up.
    * Arrow::Service: 
    - don't serialize to XML unless the client explicitly accepts
    application/xml+rubyobject.
    - Support serialization to Ruby Marshal format
    - Recurse while converting to HTML only if the object responds to #fetch *and* 
    #collect.
    * Tune HTML inspection a bit more for deep data structures
    * Bump version to 1.0.5.

   Changed: /trunk/spec/arrow/service_spec.rb
            /trunk/lib/arrow/service.rb
            /trunk/ChangeLog

    * Made Arrow::Service JSON body deserialization unwrap a hash with a single key-value pair
    with a key of Arrow::Service::SPECIAL_JSON_KEY ('single_value') as a single scalar value. This
    works around the fact that every other serialization format can represent a scalar, and
    JSON cannot.

   Changed: /trunk/lib/arrow/appletregistry.rb
            /trunk/lib/arrow.rb
            /trunk/lib/arrow/dispatcher.rb

    * Set up the configuration before the broker loads. This will mean that other configurable
    stuff will need to be preloaded, but it's better than having the logging system unconfigured
    when applets are loading.
    * Added some more logging around gem-loading parts of AppletRegistry.
    * Bumped version to 1.0.4.

    * Updated build system.
    * Template loader issue resolved by upgrading RSpec
    * Added some additional specs for service sub-resources, cleaned up example names.
    * Fleshed out FakeRequest with some more stub methods.
    * Added a deserializer for the two form-data content types to Arrow::Service
    * Made HTMLUtilities look for an #html_inspect method on the objects it's serializing,
    and then made HtmlInspectableObject use the inner html wrapper function instead of
    #make_html_for_object so objects can define their own HTML serialization more easily.

     * Converted some more Arrow::Applet tests to specs.
     * Added a singular alias for Arrow::AccessControls#unauthenticated_actions
     * Arrow::Applet: Factored out mapping an action name to a valid action into a separate
     method for smallness and ease of overriding.


-- Wed, 18 Feb 2009 18:35:08 -0000 by deveiant (r497) -----
   Changed: /trunk/lib/arrow/mixins.rb

    * Arrow::HTMLUtilities
    - Make generated HTML valid by always generating DIVs instead of SPANs, as a
    DIV can't live in a SPAN.
    - Make generated instance-variable values which are Arrays or Hashes get the
    'complex' style class instead of 'simple' for correct inline/block display.

    MERGE: Merged export-directive branch @370 into trunk.

   Changed: /branches/export-directive/lib/arrow/template/export.rb

            /branches/export-directive/tests/template.tests.rb
            /trunk/lib/arrow/template/nodes.rb


    * Finished initial implementation of the 'export' directive.

    * Made enclosing_template into a stack (enclosing_templates), and the container 

    is now pushed onto it in the #prerender method and popped off in #postrender. 

    This allows directives to have access to them before rendering begins.

    * Fixed a template test which was missing an interleaved comment in debug mode.


-- Tue, 28 Nov 2006 07:41:57 -0000 by ged (r367) -----

   Deleted: /trunk/tests/lib/arrowtestcase.rb
            /trunk/tests/lib/apacheconstants.rb


    * Rewrote logging to use Arrow::Configurable.

    * :COMPAT: The section that covers logging in the config file has changed from

    'logLevels' to 'logging'. This was done to more accurately express what the

    section can do (e.g., it can also create Arrow::Logger::Outputters in

    addition to just setting levels), and also to prevent people's configurations

    from breaking with the changes in the way logging is configured.

    * :COMPAT: Arrow::Logger::Outputter's factory constructor's signature has

    changed. It now expects a URI which encapsulates the type and its config. See

    the updated RDoc for more information. See the changes in this commit to

    source:trunk/.irbrc or source:trunk/test.rb for examples of what needs to be

    changed.

    * Added a new mixin: Arrow::Injectable to facilitate dependency injection of

    other parts of the application.

    * Added the beginnings of a unit-test infrastructure:

    - Arrow::TestCase moved into lib/arrow/

    - Arrow::AppletTestCase factored out of several Arrow projects into

    lib/arrow/.

    - Auto-vivifying stub mod_ruby classes moved into lib/apache/fakerequest.rb.

    - test.rb and tests/*.tests.rb changed to use the new infrastructure.

    * Added debugging to Arrow::Transaction that notes whether or not Arrow is

    set to dispatch from the root.

    * Added the transaction serial to the error trace logged by the Broker. This

    will make it possible to track down traces for specific requests even if the

    log level is set to 'error'.

    * Removed the deprecated #templates= method from Arrow::Transaction. All

    applets should use Arrow::Applet#load_template.

    * Cleaned up the requires in the Arrow module.

            /trunk/lib/arrow/transaction.rb
            /trunk/lib/arrow/dispatcher.rb


    * Added a workaround for Apache not setting the path_info of requests handled

    by a dispatcher bound to "/". You can now do:

    <Location />

    SetHandler ruby-object

    RubyHandler Arrow::Dispatcher.instance(:mine)

    RubyOtion root_dispatcher true

    </Location>

    which will cause the dispatcher to build URLs relative to the root.

    * Tweaked logging levels.

    * Decline requests for static content when the Status applet is mounted at "/".

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/applets/view-template.rb

            /Arrow/trunk/applets/counter.rb
            /Arrow/trunk/applets/files.rb (and 6 other/s)

   - Moved last vestiges of template-loading out of the transaction into the applet
   class. COMPAT: tx.templates[ templatekey ] should still work for the
   time-being, but should be considered deprecated and will be removed at some
   point in the future. self.loadTemplate( templatekey ) is all the rage -- trust
   me.


-- Mon, 28 Jun 2004 05:14:16 -0000 by deveiant (r115) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/broker.rb

   - Fixed identifier pattern to match single-character identifiers. Thanks to Mark

   - Moved test templates into a subdir of their own, as there's going to be quite
   a lot of them.


-- Mon, 28 Jun 2004 03:20:52 -0000 by deveiant (r111) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/templates/filemap.tmpl

   - Fixed javascript ordering bug which caused the 'expand' control to not work on
   the first click.
   - Fixed buggy element id-generation which caused all 'exapnd' controls to expand
   only the first trace. Thanks to Mark Smith <xb95@queech.com> for spotting this
   and testing.


-- Sun, 27 Jun 2004 23:36:46 -0000 by deveiant (r110) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/utils.rb

   - Removed some old cruft.
   - Fixed some embarrassing assumptions about the named of C-based modules,
   especially given I develop on a machine whose DLLs don't end in .so.

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/tests/lib/arrowtestcase.rb

   - Added per-testcase debugging (e.g., test.rb -d nameOfTestCase) so tracking
   down specific failing tests is easier.


-- Sun, 13 Jun 2004 00:24:52 -0000 by deveiant (r104) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/template/for.rb

   - Changed call to Template#withOverriddenAttributes to match the new argument
   requirements.

   - Commented out the debugging in #each I was using to eliminate Iterators from
   the "double-return" bug a while back.


-- Sun, 13 Jun 2004 00:22:18 -0000 by deveiant (r100) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/template.rb

   - Cleaned up handling of attributes and definitions in rendering scope
   code. Thanks to help from Aaron Son <reltuk at FaerieMUD dot org>.
   * Still has a bug in which definitions hang around after their containing
   scope. Rendering still works, but leaking definitions is bound to cause
   trouble in some specific situations, and at the very least is surprising
   behavior.


-- Sun, 13 Jun 2004 00:17:59 -0000 by deveiant (r99) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/exceptions.rb

   - Added ScopeError exception class.

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/applet.rb
            /Arrow/trunk/templates/applet-status.tmpl

   - Uncommented the Arrow::Applet#delegate method, and added a new #delegable?
   method to test for a real delegation method. The method used to test for
   #delegable? is a hack, but it's the only way I could find to test to see which
   class a Method object gets its definition from. Suggestions for a better way
   welcomed.


-- Sat, 05 Jun 2004 19:08:16 -0000 by deveiant (r96) -----

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/applets/dingus.rb
            /Arrow/trunk/templates/dingus.tmpl

   - Fixed initial bugs. Now in working form.
   - Had to remove the :filters argument from the validator profile, as it caused
   an error to occur. Need to investigate further and perhaps hack on
   FormValidator a bit to fix it.


-- Wed, 02 Jun 2004 03:01:19 -0000 by deveiant (r90) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/broker.rb

   - Fixed up two old-style invocations of #runAppletChain.

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/templates/applet-status.tmpl

-- Mon, 31 May 2004 18:25:09 -0000 by deveiant (r82) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/exceptions.rb

   - Added a new exception type for applet chain errors, since they're now exposed
   to the user in delegation.


-- Mon, 31 May 2004 18:23:28 -0000 by deveiant (r81) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/dispatcher.rb

   - Made changes to the order of execution of output rendering and saving of
   sessions so that changes made to the session or request headers from code
   executing via the template will still work. This also corrects the
   session-locking bug I had been experiencing.


-- Mon, 31 May 2004 18:20:58 -0000 by deveiant (r80) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/broker.rb

   - Made delegation pass the remaining links in the applet chain to
   Applet#delegate so delegating apps can inject or remove links if they want.


-- Mon, 31 May 2004 17:46:21 -0000 by deveiant (r79) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/applet.rb

   - Fixed the double-return bug that happened when the default handler was invoked
   by #action_missing_action. Default handler is now handled separately (again?).

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/applets/protected.rb

   double-return bug.

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/session/lock.rb

-- Sat, 29 May 2004 20:41:14 -0000 by deveiant (r68) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/applets/protected.rb

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/applets/counter.rb

   - Made session setup for delegated requests a bit more resilient in the face of
   session errors.

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/tests/broker.tests.rb

   - Removed default layout, as it merged with the user's config.
   - Added a bunch of tests for chaining, etc.


-- Sat, 22 May 2004 06:58:12 -0000 by deveiant (r61) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/test.rb

   - Modified file logging to apply to more than just Arrow::Template.

            /Arrow/trunk/templates/status.tmpl

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/session.rb

   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/config.rb

   - Moved applet config stuff into the applet section of the config object.

   - Handle Symbols in the munging of the config structs into a dumpable
   hash-of-hashes.


-- Sat, 22 May 2004 06:50:19 -0000 by deveiant (r57) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/broker.rb

   - Rewrote applet registry code to support the URL hierarchy being built from
   config rather than from the applet signatures.
   - Exposed a file mapping attribute to facilitate introspection into the
   load/reload process.
   - Moved applet config stuff into the applet section of the config object.


-- Sat, 22 May 2004 06:47:41 -0000 by deveiant (r56) -----
   Changed: /Arrow/trunk/lib/arrow/applet.rb

   - Applets are no longer responsible for their own mapping into the URL
   hierarchy, so removed the :uri member from the signature struct.
   - Added Subversion-style rev tags to the auto-population code for the version
   member of the signature struct.
   - Made the (re-)loading code a bit more robust.

            /Arrow/trunk/applets/args.rb (and 8 other/s)

   - Moved back out of the Arrow:: namespace, as Kernel::load apparently doesn't
   put them in an anonymous module that way even with the appropriate flag set.
   - Updated subversion keywords.
   - Updated some to reflect changes in the broker and the applet class.

   - Initial conversion of applet-to-uri mapping in the config file (a new 'layout'

   Deleted: /Arrow/trunk/applets/protected-hello.rb
